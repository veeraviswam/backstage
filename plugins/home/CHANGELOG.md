## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b7d3455b: Create the `Home` plugin which exports some basic functionality that's used to compose a homepage. An example of a composed homepage is added to the example app.

  This change also introduces the `createCardExtension` which creates a lazy loaded card that is intended to be used for homepage components.

  Adoption of this homepage requires setup similar to what can be found in the example app.
